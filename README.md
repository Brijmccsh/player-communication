# Java Player Communication Simulation

This project is a simple Java-based communication simulation between two players. The "initiator" player sends a message to the second player, who responds with a message that appends a counter. The exchange continues until the initiator sends and receives back 10 messages, at which point the program ends gracefully.

# Key Features

Two Player Communication: Two players communicate by sending messages with incremental counters.
Single and Separate Process Modes: Supports running both players in the same Java process or in separate processes.
No External Libraries: Pure Java project with Maven for build management.
Shell Script Included: Run the program with an included script.
This project is a demonstration of simple inter-process communication and basic message handling in Java, focusing on clean, maintainable code structure.
